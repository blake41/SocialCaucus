You'll need to install redis to use Resque
redis is a key value store
If you're on OS X you can use homebrew to install it.
Most of this app is run from the command line and has no views/GUI

Steps to get this up and running:
bundle install
edit database.yml and call the dbs whatever you want
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed

from the console (rails c)
Politician.get_user_id_from_screen_name 
This uses my apigee URL to hit twitters REST API (please substitute your own URL at the top of the politician model)

optional - 
Politician.get_tweets_by_politicians
Politician.get_politicians_friends

resque tasks from the Command line
resque-web will give you a web interface

from the console
Task.start_cycle
then go to the resque-web interface and see the queues that have been created

from the CL
I usually run three workers working the three main queues, but if you did the optional tasks you'll want workers to work these queues also
rake resque:work QUEUE=nameofqueue
